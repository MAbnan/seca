SECA – Self-Evolving Cognitive Architecture

SECA (Self-Evolving Cognitive Architecture) is a research-oriented framework designed to explore self-evolving neural network architectures regulated by explicit self-evaluation mechanisms. The system combines evolutionary neural architecture search, gradient-based learning, and cognitive-inspired regulation to create adaptive neural models that can improve across generations without manual architecture design.

The goal of SECA is not to claim general intelligence or consciousness but to demonstrate the feasibility of self-regulated architecture evolution within a unified framework.

Project Overview

Modern deep learning systems typically rely on manually designed neural architectures, while automated approaches such as Neural Architecture Search (NAS) or neuroevolution focus primarily on optimizing architectures using performance metrics.

SECA extends this idea by introducing a cognitive-inspired regulatory layer that evaluates model behavior and regulates evolutionary processes.

In SECA:

Neural architectures evolve across generations

Each architecture is trained using gradient descent

Performance and behavior are evaluated using multiple metrics

A self-evaluation layer regulates the evolutionary process

This allows the system to move beyond blind architecture search toward self-regulated adaptive optimization.

Key Features
Self-Evolving Neural Architectures

Neural network structures are encoded as genomes and evolve using evolutionary operators such as mutation and selection.

Gradient-Based Learning

Each evolved architecture is trained using standard deep learning optimizers such as Adam.

Cognitive-Inspired Self-Evaluation

SECA includes a regulatory layer that performs:

performance introspection

confidence estimation

evolutionary regulation

This layer does not modify weights directly, but instead controls when and how architectural evolution occurs.

Modular Research Framework

The architecture is divided into clearly separated modules:

Evolution

Learning

Evaluation

Cognitive Regulation

This modular design allows the framework to be easily extended for future research.

System Workflow

The SECA pipeline follows a multi-stage process:

Initialize a population of neural architectures.

Encode each architecture as a genome.

Train architectures using gradient-based learning.

Evaluate performance and model efficiency.

Perform self-evaluation through the cognitive layer.

Apply evolutionary operations to produce the next generation.

Repeat the process for multiple generations.

Running SECA

To run the SECA evolution process:

python main.py

or

python experiments/run_evolution.py

This will:

initialize the population

train neural architectures

evolve networks across generations

log performance metrics

Example Output

During execution, the system prints results such as:

=== Generation 0 ===
Ind 0: acc=0.88, params=35130
Ind 1: acc=0.89, params=108474

Best this generation:
accuracy = 0.89
parameters = 35130

The system logs:

generation performance

architecture configurations

evolution history

Experimental Setup

The current implementation is designed as a proof-of-concept framework.

Typical experimental setup:

Dataset: MNIST or small image classification datasets

Population size: 5–10 architectures

Generations: 5–10

Optimizer: Adam

Fitness metrics:

accuracy

model complexity

stability

Limitations

The current implementation has several limitations:

experiments are performed on small datasets

evolutionary search is computationally expensive

the cognitive layer is rule-based rather than learned

These limitations are expected in an early research prototype.

Future Work

Future work will extend SECA toward the full architecture proposed in the research paper.

Planned improvements include:

learned cognitive regulation using reinforcement learning

probabilistic self-modeling

surrogate-assisted architecture search

scaling to larger datasets

multi-task adaptive learning

These extensions will gradually bridge the gap between the current prototype implementation and the conceptual SECA framework proposed in the paper.

Research Context

SECA is inspired by research in:

Neural Architecture Search (NAS)

Neuroevolution

Meta-learning

Cognitive architectures

Adaptive AI systems

However, the focus of this project is framework integration and feasibility, not theoretical novelty.
